# Getting Started with Create React App

ðŸ“Œ Project Description: Cryptocurrency Tracker & Analytics Dashboard This project is a Cryptocurrency Tracking and Analytics Dashboard built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Chart.js. It fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the CoinRanking API and provides users with:

âœ… Live Cryptocurrency Prices â€“ Displays the latest market prices of various cryptocurrencies. âœ… Detailed Crypto Information â€“ Shows coin-specific details like market cap, supply, volume, and price changes. âœ… Interactive Price Charts â€“ Visualizes historical price trends with Line Charts using Chart.js. âœ… Timeframe Selection â€“ Allows users to analyze price movements over different timeframes (e.g., 24h, 7d, 30d). âœ… News & Insights â€“ Fetches the latest cryptocurrency news. âœ… Responsive UI â€“ Designed using Ant Design for a modern, user-friendly experience.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used: Frontend: React.js, Redux Toolkit, Chart.js, Ant Design

API: CoinRanking API (for crypto data), RapidAPI

State Management: Redux Toolkit Query

Data Visualization: Chart.js








This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
